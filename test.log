Feature: Calculate social insurance contributions
  
  As a Employee
  I want to calculate my social insurance contributions based on my gross salary
  So that I can make plans with my net salary

  Scenario Outline: calculate social insurance contributions # features/social_insurance_calculator.feature:7
    Given I am "<years>" old                                 # features/social_insurance_calculator.feature:8
    And I have "<children>" child / children                 # features/social_insurance_calculator.feature:9
    When I have "<gross_salary>" gross salary                # features/social_insurance_calculator.feature:10
    Then the outcome should be "<total_contributions>"       # features/social_insurance_calculator.feature:11

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given /^I am "(.*?)" old$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given /^I have "(.*?)" child \/ children$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I have "(.*?)" gross salary$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^the outcome should be "(.*?)"$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
